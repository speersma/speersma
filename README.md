# Who Am I?
- 👋 Hi, I’m @speersma. I am a graduate student studying criminal justice and computational mathematics.
- 👀 I’m interested in the application of spatial crime data to agent-based modeling techniques. I'm interested in building advanced agent-based models that incorporate theoretically relevant agent attributes
- 🌱 I’m currently learning methods of computational modeling using python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that incorporate interesting data (especially spatial data)
- 📫 How to reach me: speersma@gmail.com
